            <h2>House of the Lord</h2>
            <p>Temples are houses of the Lord. They are holy places of worship where individuals make sacred covenants with God. Throughout history, the Lord has commanded His people to build temples to give His people temple to make temple blessings more available all over the world. </p>

            <h2>A Place of Learning</h2>
            <p>Temples are places of learning. Temples provide ordinances necessary for the children of God to enable them to return to dwell with Him. I love to go to the temple. Everytime I go there I can feel the Holy Spirit. I'm grateful that there's a temple in our country. We can go there often to receive our temple ordinancies and blessings.</p>
